                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a thrilling adventure sport that involves flying through the air using a parachute-like wing. The pilot is suspended beneath a fabric wing, and the entire system is lightweight and portable. The wing, or paraglider, is designed to allow the pilot to harness the natural lift in the air to stay aloft. <br><br>
                Paragliding is often done in scenic locations, and pilots launch themselves from elevated points like hills or mountains. The sport offers a unique perspective of the landscape as participants soar through the sky, relying on their skills to navigate and control the paraglider.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>  
            <p class="text">Surfing is a dynamic water sport that involves riding the waves on a surfboard. Surfers paddle out into the ocean, wait for the right wave, and then use their skills to catch and ride it back to shore. The goal is to balance on the board while navigating the moving wave—a delicate dance between the surfer, the board, and the ocean. <br><br>
                It's not just a sport; surfing is often described as a lifestyle. The culture surrounding surfing is laid-back and often associated with a love for the beach, the ocean, and a sense of camaraderie among surfers. Whether you're a seasoned pro carving through powerful waves or a beginner catching small ripples close to shore, there's a unique joy in the art of riding the waves.
